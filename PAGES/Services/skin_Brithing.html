                    Clear, even-toned skin plays a vital role in enhancing your
                    appearance and confidence. Concerns such as pigmentation,
                    dullness, and uneven skin tone are common and can develop due
                    to sun exposure, hormonal changes, and lifestyle factors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At DermaCo., our advanced skin brightening and pigmentation
                    treatments are dermatologist-led and designed to effectively
                    target discoloration, dark spots, and uneven tone, helping
                    restore your skin’s natural radiance.

        <h3 class="section-title">Understanding Skin Pigmentation</h3>

        <p>
            Pigmentation refers to the coloring of the skin caused by melanin.
            There are two main types of pigmentation—hyperpigmentation, which
            appears as dark patches, and hypopigmentation, which appears as light
            patches on the skin.
        </p>

        <p>
            While pigmentation is not harmful, it can significantly affect skin
            appearance and confidence if left untreated.

        <h3 class="section-title">The Role of Melanin</h3>

        <p>
            Melanin is produced by melanocytes and determines the color of our
            skin. It also acts as a natural defense against harmful UV radiation.
            When skin is exposed to sunlight, melanin production increases,
            leading to tanning or darkened patches.
        </p>

        <p>
            Excess melanin production can result in uneven skin tone, dark spots,
            and long-term pigmentation concerns.

        <h3 class="section-title">Sun Exposure and Skin Pigmentation</h3>

        <p>
            Sun exposure is one of the primary causes of pigmentation. UVA rays
            penetrate deep into the skin, leading to premature aging and
            pigmentation, while UVB rays affect the surface, causing sunburn and
            discoloration.
        </p>

        <p>
            Prolonged exposure can result in sunspots, uneven skin tone, and
            premature aging. Regular sunscreen use is essential to protect the
            skin both indoors and outdoors.

        <h3 class="section-title">Hormonal Influences on Skin Pigmentation</h3>

        <p>
            Hormonal changes during pregnancy, puberty, menopause, or due to
            birth control pills can cause melasma—a form of pigmentation that
            appears as dark patches on the face.
        </p>

        <p>
            Managing hormonal pigmentation requires professional evaluation and
            a personalised treatment approach under dermatologist supervision.

        <h4>Chemical Peels for Skin Brightening</h4>

        <p>
            Chemical peels exfoliate the outer layer of skin to reveal brighter,
            healthier skin underneath. They help reduce pigmentation, improve
            skin texture, and restore radiance.

            Advanced laser technologies target melanin deposits and break them
            down safely. The body naturally eliminates the pigment, resulting in
            clearer and more even-toned skin.
