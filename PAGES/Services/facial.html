                                </h3>

                                <p>
                                    At DermaCo., we believe that healthy, glowing skin plays a vital role in
                                    boosting confidence and overall appearance. Our clinic-based facial
                                    treatments are dermatologist-led and designed to address a wide range
                                    of skin concerns such as dullness, uneven skin tone, acne, pigmentation,
                                    and early signs of ageing.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Each facial treatment is carefully planned after analysing your skin
                                    type, condition, and specific concerns. We use advanced techniques and
                                    medically approved products to ensure safe, effective, and long-lasting
                                    results while maintaining the natural balance of your skin.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Our facial treatments work by deeply cleansing the skin, gently
                                    exfoliating dead skin cells, improving blood circulation, and delivering
                                    essential nutrients to the skin layers. This structured approach helps
                                    restore skin health, enhance natural radiance, and improve overall skin
                                    texture.

                                <p>
                                    Regular facial treatments not only improve current skin concerns but
                                    also help prevent premature ageing by supporting collagen production
                                    and improving skin elasticity. With consistent care, the skin appears
                                    smoother, brighter, and more youthful.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Facial treatments are professional skincare procedures performed in a
                                    clinical setting to improve the health, appearance, and function of
                                    the skin. Unlike regular home skincare routines, facial treatments work
                                    deeper into the skin to remove impurities, unclog pores, and promote
                                    healthy skin renewal.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    These treatments involve multiple steps such as deep cleansing,
                                    exfoliation, hydration, and targeted nourishment. Each step plays a
                                    crucial role in improving skin texture, hydration levels, and overall
                                    skin vitality.
                                </p>

                                </h3>

                                <p>
                                    Facial treatment essence is a lightweight, fast-absorbing skincare solution
                                    used during professional facial procedures to deeply hydrate and prepare the
                                    skin for better absorption of active ingredients. It plays a key role in
                                    improving skin texture, hydration levels, and overall skin health.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Inspired by advanced Korean and Japanese skincare techniques, facial
                                    treatment essences contain concentrated ingredients such as hyaluronic
                                    acid, vitamins, antioxidants, and botanical extracts. These ingredients
                                    work together to nourish the skin and strengthen its natural barrier.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    During a facial treatment, the essence is applied after cleansing and
                                    exfoliation. It helps balance the skin’s pH level and enhances the
                                    effectiveness of serums and moisturizers applied in later steps.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Regular use of facial treatment essences improves skin hydration,
                                    smoothness, and elasticity. It also helps reduce dryness, dullness,
                                    and early signs of ageing, making it an essential component of
                                    professional facial treatments.

                                <h4>Are facial treatments safe?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Yes. Facial treatments at DermaCo. are dermatologist-led and performed using
                                    clinically approved products and techniques. Treatments are customized based
                                    on individual skin type and concerns to ensure safety and effectiveness.
                                </p>

                                <h4>How often should facial treatments be done?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The frequency of facial treatments depends on your skin type, concerns, and
                                    treatment goals. Generally, facials can be done once every 3–4 weeks, as
                                    recommended by our dermatologists.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Is there any downtime after facial treatments?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Most facial treatments have little to no downtime. Mild redness or sensitivity
                                    may occur after certain procedures, which usually subsides within a short time.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Can facial treatments be customized?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Absolutely. At DermaCo., every facial treatment is personalized after a detailed
                                    skin assessment to address specific concerns such as acne, pigmentation,
                                    dryness, or ageing.

                                <p>
                                    Some facial treatments deliver instant glow and hydration, while others may
                                    require multiple sessions for long-term improvement. Your dermatologist will
                                    guide you on expected outcomes during consultation.

                    A HydraFacial is a multi-step treatment that deeply cleanses, exfoliates, and hydrates the skin
                    using a specialized device. It effectively targets concerns like fine lines, wrinkles, acne,
                    pigmentation, and overall dullness. The treatment delivers instant brightness and smoothness,
                    leaving the skin refreshed and rejuvenated.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The DermaCo Aqua Facial uses water-based solutions to deeply cleanse, exfoliate, and hydrate the
                    skin. It starts with a gentle water stream to remove impurities, followed by a water-based exfoliant
                    to slough off dead skin cells. The treatment infuses hydrating serums for deep moisture, making it
                    ideal for dry, dehydrated, or sensitive skin. Regular DermaCo Aqua Facial sessions improve skin
                    texture, reduce fine lines, and enhance overall radiance, leaving a fresh and healthy complexion.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The DermaCo Microdermabrasion Facial uses a specialized device to gently exfoliate the outer layer
                    of dead skin cells with tiny crystals or a diamond-tipped wand, while a vacuum removes the
                    exfoliated cells. This non-invasive 30–60 minute treatment improves skin texture, reduces fine
                    lines, and diminishes hyperpigmentation. Slight redness or sensitivity may occur but usually
                    subsides quickly. Regular DermaCo Microdermabrasion sessions promote smoother, more radiant skin and
                    enhance overall skin tone.

                    The frequency of DermaCo facial treatments depends on your skin type, concerns, and the specific
                    treatment. Generally, facials are recommended every 4–6 weeks to maintain healthy skin. Treatments
                    like DermaCo HydraFacial or Aqua Facial may be done bi-weekly for intensive care, while
                    Microdermabrasion Facials are typically every 2–4 weeks. Oxygen and Medi Facials follow a schedule
                    advised by your dermatologist. Regular DermaCo facials help maintain a clear, radiant complexion and
                    prevent future skin issues.
