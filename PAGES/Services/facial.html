                <h3>Rejuvenate Your Skin with DermaCo.'s Clinic Facial Treatments</h3>

                <p>
                    At DermaCo., we believe healthy, glowing skin plays a big role in how confident you feel. Our
                    specialized facial treatments are designed to target a wide range of skin concerns and deliver
                    visible results. Whether you're facing dark spots, pigmentation issues, or deeper wrinkles, DermaCo.
                    offers advanced solutions tailored to your skin’s needs.
                </p>
                <h3>What are Facial Treatments?</h3>
                <p>
                    Facial treatments are targeted skincare procedures that help improve the health, look, and feel of
                    your skin. They combine different techniques and products to address concerns like dryness,
                    dullness, acne, pigmentation, and early signs of aging. The main purpose is to refine skin texture,
                    brighten the complexion, and enhance overall radiance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These treatments offer several key benefits. They deeply cleanse the skin, clearing out dirt, excess
                    oil, and impurities that often lead to clogged pores and breakouts. Facials also stimulate blood
                    circulation, helping skin cells receive more oxygen and nutrients, which supports natural repair and
                    gives the skin a healthier glow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most facial treatments include gentle exfoliation to remove dead skin cells and promote smoother,
                    more even-toned skin. Hydration is another important advantage — moisturizing steps in the facial
                    keep the skin soft, plump, and nourished. With regular sessions, facials can also help reduce the
                    appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by boosting collagen and improving skin elasticity.
                </p>
                <h3>Types of Facial Treatments</h3>
                <h4>HydraFacial</h4>
                <p>
                    The HydraFacial is an advanced multi-step treatment designed to cleanse, exfoliate, and deeply
                    hydrate the skin using a specialized device. It begins with gentle cleansing and exfoliation to
                    remove dead skin cells and surface impurities. A mild acid solution is then used to loosen debris
                    inside the pores without causing irritation.

                    Next, a painless vacuum-based extraction clears clogged pores, followed by the final step — infusing
                    the skin with nourishing, hydrating serums customized to concerns like fine lines, uneven tone,
                    pigmentation, and dullness.

                    Suitable for every skin type, the HydraFacial delivers instant brightness and smoothness, leaving
                    the skin fresh, rejuvenated, and glowing right after the session.
                </p>
                <h4>Aqua Facial</h4>
                <p>
                    An Aqua Facial uses water-based solutions to gently cleanse, exfoliate, and deeply hydrate the skin.
                    The treatment begins with a soft water jet that removes dirt, oil, and surface impurities. A mild
                    water-based exfoliant is then applied to shed dead skin cells and reveal a smoother, fresher layer
                    beneath.

                    Hydrating serums are infused through the same water stream, allowing them to penetrate easily and
                    replenish moisture from within. This makes Aqua Facials especially effective for dry, dehydrated, or
                    dull skin. Because the process is gentle and soothing, it’s also ideal for sensitive skin,
                    delivering instant hydration and a plump, refreshed look without irritation or redness.
                </p>
                <h4>Oxygen Facial</h4>
                <p>
                    An Oxygen Facial delivers a pressurized stream of oxygen enriched with skin-boosting vitamins and
                    nutrients to instantly refresh and energize the skin. This treatment helps detoxify the skin, boosts
                    collagen production, and elevates hydration levels — making it a popular choice for achieving a
                    bright, glowing complexion, especially before events.

                    The oxygen infusion improves blood circulation, allowing the skin to absorb essential nutrients more
                    effectively while helping flush out toxins. As a result, the skin appears smoother, revitalized, and
                    more youthful. Suitable for all skin types, Oxygen Facials are particularly beneficial for dull,
                    fatigued skin and for those wanting to reduce signs of aging and environmental stress.
                </p>
                <h3>Facial Treatment Essence</h3>
                <p>A facial treatment essence is a lightweight, hydrating liquid used after cleansing and toning, and
                    before serums or moisturizers. Inspired by Korean and Japanese skincare, essences contain
                    concentrated active ingredients that deeply hydrate and prep the skin for better product absorption.

                    Their main purpose is to improve how well the skin receives subsequent treatments by balancing pH
                    levels and boosting moisture. Common ingredients include hyaluronic acid, glycerin, fermented
                    extracts, vitamins, and antioxidants — all of which help nourish, protect, and strengthen the skin.
                </p>

                    What are the benefits of a HydraFacial?

                    A HydraFacial is a multi-step treatment that deeply cleanses, exfoliates, and hydrates the skin
                    using a specialized device. It effectively targets concerns like fine lines, wrinkles, acne,
                    pigmentation, and overall dullness. The treatment delivers instant brightness and smoothness,
                    leaving the skin refreshed and rejuvenated.

                    How does an Aqua Facial work?

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The DermaCo Aqua Facial uses water-based solutions to deeply cleanse, exfoliate, and hydrate the
                    skin. It starts with a gentle water stream to remove impurities, followed by a water-based exfoliant
                    to slough off dead skin cells. The treatment infuses hydrating serums for deep moisture, making it
                    ideal for dry, dehydrated, or sensitive skin. Regular DermaCo Aqua Facial sessions improve skin
                    texture, reduce fine lines, and enhance overall radiance, leaving a fresh and healthy complexion.

                <div class="faq-question">
                    What should I expect during a Microdermabrasion Facial?

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The DermaCo Microdermabrasion Facial uses a specialized device to gently exfoliate the outer layer
                    of dead skin cells with tiny crystals or a diamond-tipped wand, while a vacuum removes the
                    exfoliated cells. This non-invasive 30–60 minute treatment improves skin texture, reduces fine
                    lines, and diminishes hyperpigmentation. Slight redness or sensitivity may occur but usually
                    subsides quickly. Regular DermaCo Microdermabrasion sessions promote smoother, more radiant skin and
                    enhance overall skin tone.

                    and nutrients directly to the skin. It detoxifies, promotes collagen production, enhances hydration,

                    skin types, the treatment revives dull, tired skin, leaving it refreshed, rejuvenated, and radiant
                    with improved texture and a youthful glow.

                    The frequency of DermaCo facial treatments depends on your skin type, concerns, and the specific
                    treatment. Generally, facials are recommended every 4–6 weeks to maintain healthy skin. Treatments
                    like DermaCo HydraFacial or Aqua Facial may be done bi-weekly for intensive care, while
                    Microdermabrasion Facials are typically every 2–4 weeks. Oxygen and Medi Facials follow a schedule
                    advised by your dermatologist. Regular DermaCo facials help maintain a clear, radiant complexion and
                    prevent future skin issues.
