                    <p>
                        Laser Hair Reduction is an advanced aesthetic treatment designed to
                        reduce unwanted body hair by targeting hair follicles using controlled
                        laser energy. It is a safe and effective alternative to shaving,
                        waxing, or threading.
                    </p>

                        At DermaCo., Laser Hair Reduction treatments are dermatologist-led and
                        performed using advanced laser technology suitable for Indian skin
                        types. Over multiple sessions, the treatment helps convert thick,
                        dark hair into finer, lighter hair.

                    <p>
                        Laser Hair Reduction works by directing laser energy toward the
                        melanin pigment present in hair follicles. The laser damages the
                        follicle without harming the surrounding skin.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over multiple sessions, hair growth slows down significantly, and
                        regrowth becomes finer and lighter.

                    Does Laser Hair Reduction permanently remove hair?

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Laser Hair Reduction significantly reduces hair growth.
                    While it may not permanently remove all hair, it makes the
                    hair finer, lighter, and slower-growing over multiple
                    sessions, resulting in long-lasting hair reduction.

                    How does Laser Hair Reduction work?

                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Laser Hair Reduction works by directing laser energy toward
                    the melanin pigment in hair follicles. The laser damages the
                    follicle without affecting the surrounding skin, thereby
                    slowing down future hair growth safely and effectively.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The number of sessions depends on factors such as the
                    treatment area, hair thickness, hair growth cycle, and
                    individual response. Most individuals require multiple
                    sessions for optimal and long-lasting results.
