        <h2>About Acne</h2>
        <p>Acne and acne scar treatments have existed long before modern lifestyles or diet habits came into play.
           Historical texts—from ancient scriptures to classic literature—often mention “skin eruptions,” showing that
           acne has been a concern across centuries.</p>
        <p>These skin issues have sometimes been misunderstood, affecting self-confidence. Over time, acne has taken on
           many forms and names, which can make it tricky to know which types leave scars and which require professional
           treatment.</p>
        <p>DermaCo offers solutions to help tackle acne effectively while minimizing long-term scarring.</p>

        <h2>What is Acne?</h2>
        <p>Acne occurs when pores in our skin get clogged with excess oil (sebum) and dead skin cells. These tiny pores,
           from where hair grows, can get blocked, leading to bumps, pimples, whiteheads, blackheads, blemishes, acne
           spots, and scars on the face, chest, and back.</p>
        <p>Acne is not just a teenage issue—adults can experience it frequently as well.</p>

        <h2>What are Acne Scars?</h2>
        <p>Acne scars are marks left behind after acne heals. They appear as raised or depressed areas on the skin and
           are often stubborn, affecting confidence.</p>

        <h3>Types of Acne Scars</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hypertrophic Scars:</strong> Thick, raised scars caused by excess collagen during healing, more
            common in darker skin tones.</li>
          <li><strong>Atrophic Scars:</strong> Depressed or sunken scars caused by tissue loss, including icepick,
            boxcar, and rolling scars.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who is Likely to Get Acne Scars?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>People with inflamed, swollen, or painful acne.</li>
          <li>Those who don’t properly treat inflammatory acne.</li>
          <li>People who pick, squeeze, or pop pimples.</li>
          <li>Individuals with a family history of acne scars.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>Different Types of Acne</h2>
        <p>Acne can appear in several forms, each with unique causes and symptoms. Understanding the type of acne helps in
           choosing the right treatment.</p>

        <h3>Fungal Acne</h3>
        <p>A mild form caused by yeast overgrowth in skin pores due to moisture, tight clothing, or weak immunity. It
           often appears as clustered breakouts and may cause itchiness or stinging.</p>

        <h3>Cystic Acne</h3>
        <p>A severe type featuring deep, pus-filled pimples. Caused by bacterial blockage of pores, it can lead to
           long-lasting scars if untreated.</p>

        <h3>Hormonal Acne</h3>
        <p>Moderate acne linked to hormone fluctuations, affecting sebum production. Common triggers include menstrual
           cycles, pregnancy, menopause, stress, diet, and certain medical conditions.</p>

        <h3>Nodular Acne</h3>
        <p>Severe acne characterized by large, painful lumps deep under the skin. These nodules usually appear as red
           bumps without whiteheads or blackheads at the center.</p>

        <h3>Other Less Common Types</h3>
        <p>Whiteheads, blackheads, papules, and pustules are additional forms of acne. Regardless of type, acne can be
           painful, irritating, and impact confidence. Proper skin care and professional guidance can help manage and
           reduce it effectively.</p>
