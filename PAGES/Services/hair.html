                    <p>
                        Hair loss is a common yet complex concern influenced by multiple factors such as
                        genetics, hormonal imbalance, hair growth cycle disruptions, nutritional
                        deficiencies, stress, and lifestyle habits. Healthy hair plays a significant
                        role in confidence, self-image, and overall well-being.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Concerns like excessive hair fall, thinning hair, dandruff, widening parting,
                        or a receding hairline can be emotionally distressing. Noticing hair strands on
                        pillows, combs, or shower drains often indicates underlying scalp or follicle
                        issues that require expert attention.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At DermaCo., our dermatologist-led hair loss solutions focus on identifying and
                        treating the root cause rather than just addressing visible symptoms. Each
                        treatment plan is carefully personalised based on your hair type, scalp
                        condition, and stage of hair loss.

                        Understanding the Hair Growth Cycle
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        To effectively manage hair loss, it is important to understand how hair
                        grows naturally. Hair growth follows a structured cycle, and disruption
                        in any phase of this cycle can result in increased hair fall, thinning,
                        or reduced hair density.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each hair strand goes through multiple growth stages throughout its life.
                        Factors such as genetics, hormonal imbalance, stress, illness, and
                        nutritional deficiencies can disturb this cycle, leading to visible hair
                        concerns.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Anagen Phase (Growth Phase)</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is the active growth phase, lasting between 2 to 7 years. During this
                        phase, hair grows continuously at an average rate of about half an inch
                        per month. A healthy anagen phase is essential for strong and thick hair.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Catagen Phase (Transition Phase)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The catagen phase is a short transition period that lasts around 10 days.
                        During this stage, hair stops growing and detaches from the blood supply,
                        preparing for the resting phase.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Telogen Phase (Resting Phase)</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the telogen phase, hair remains in the follicle without active growth.
                        Around 10–15% of hair is usually in this phase at any given time. This
                        phase lasts approximately 3 months.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Exogen Phase (Shedding Phase)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The exogen phase marks the natural shedding of hair strands. Old hair falls
                        out to make space for new hair growth, allowing the cycle to begin again.

                    <p>
                        Hair loss treatment at DermaCo. is dermatologist-led and customised after
                        evaluating your scalp health, hair density, and the stage of hair loss.
                        Our treatments focus on stimulating hair follicles, improving scalp
                        circulation, and strengthening hair roots for long-term results.
                    </p>

                    <h4>PRP Therapy</h4>
                    <p>
                        Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy uses growth factors derived from your
                        own blood to stimulate natural hair regrowth. It helps improve hair
                        thickness, reduce hair fall, and strengthen weak follicles.
                    </p>

                    <h4>QR678 Hair Therapy</h4>
                    <p>
                        QR678 is a painless, growth-factor-based treatment designed to activate
                        dormant hair follicles. It is effective for early to moderate hair loss
                        and helps improve overall hair density.
                    </p>

                    <h4>PDO Hair Thread Treatment</h4>
                    <p>
                        PDO hair thread treatment stimulates collagen production in the scalp,
                        improving blood flow and hair follicle strength. It is a non-surgical
                        procedure suitable for thinning hair.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Intensive Hair Root Therapy (IHRT)</h4>
                    <p>
                        IHRT is a non-invasive treatment that improves scalp circulation,
                        nourishes hair roots, and helps activate inactive follicles using
                        advanced techniques.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Hair Nutri-Infusion Therapy</h4>
                    <p>
                        This therapy delivers essential vitamins and minerals directly to the
                        scalp, helping strengthen hair roots, reduce hair fall, and improve
                        overall hair health.

                    <p>
                        The cost of hair loss treatment depends on several factors such as the type
                        of treatment recommended, the severity of hair loss, the number of sessions
                        required, and individual scalp and hair conditions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At DermaCo., hair loss treatments are dermatologist-led and personalised.
                        This ensures that you receive a treatment plan that is both effective and
                        cost-efficient, targeting the root cause of hair fall rather than providing
                        temporary solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Advanced treatments such as PRP Therapy, QR678 Therapy, PDO Hair Thread
                        Treatment, and Nutri-Infusion Therapy may vary in cost based on the technology
                        used and treatment duration. A detailed cost estimate is shared after a
                        thorough consultation.
