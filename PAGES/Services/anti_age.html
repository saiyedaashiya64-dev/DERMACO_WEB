          <h3 class="section-title">About Anti-Ageing Treatment</h3>

          <p>
            Anti-ageing treatment focuses on reducing visible signs of skin ageing such
            as fine lines, wrinkles, sagging skin, uneven texture, and loss of firmness.
            These changes occur naturally with age but can appear earlier due to
            sun exposure, stress, pollution, hormonal changes, and lifestyle habits.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Derma Co, anti-ageing treatments are dermatologist-led and medically
            designed to improve overall skin health rather than only surface-level
            correction. Each treatment plan is customized after analysing skin type,
            age, concerns, and long-term skin goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our advanced treatments work by stimulating collagen and elastin
            production, improving skin renewal, and repairing existing skin damage.
            With the right approach, anti-ageing care helps slow down premature ageing
            and maintain youthful, healthy skin for the long term.
          </p>

          <p>
            Early anti-ageing intervention not only improves current skin concerns
            but also prevents deeper wrinkles and sagging in the future, making it a
            preventive as well as corrective treatment.

          <h3 class="section-title">Why Skin Ageing Happens</h3>

          <p>
            Skin ageing is a natural biological process that occurs due to a gradual
            decline in collagen and elastin, the proteins responsible for skin firmness
            and elasticity. As their production slows down, the skin becomes thinner,
            less firm, and more prone to wrinkles and sagging.
          </p>

          <p>
            External factors play a major role in accelerating ageing. Prolonged sun
            exposure damages collagen fibers, leading to premature wrinkles and
            pigmentation. Pollution, smoking, stress, and poor lifestyle habits further
            weaken the skin’s natural repair mechanism.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hormonal changes, especially during the late 30s, menopause, or due to
            medical conditions, can cause dryness, loss of elasticity, and dullness.
            Reduced cell renewal also slows down skin healing and regeneration.
          </p>

          <p>
            Understanding the cause of ageing helps dermatologists design the right
            treatment plan. At Derma Co, treatments target both internal and external
            ageing factors to slow down visible ageing and protect long-term skin health.

          <h3 class="section-title">Why Skin Ages</h3>

          <p>
            Skin ages due to collagen loss, sun damage,
            pollution, stress, and lifestyle habits.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hormonal changes and reduced skin renewal

          <h3 class="section-title">Anti-Ageing Treatments at Derma Co</h3>

          <p>
            At Derma Co, anti-ageing treatments are customized based on age, skin type,
            severity of ageing, and individual skin concerns. Our dermatologist-led
            approach focuses on improving skin quality, firmness, and long-term health.
          </p>

          <h4>Chemical Peels</h4>
          <p>
            Chemical peels help remove damaged outer skin layers, improve skin texture,
            reduce pigmentation, and soften fine lines. They are ideal for early signs
            of ageing and dull, uneven skin tone.
          </p>

          <h4>Laser & Energy-Based Treatments</h4>
          <p>
            Laser treatments stimulate collagen production in deeper skin layers,
            improving firmness, reducing wrinkles, and enhancing overall skin tone.
            These treatments are effective for moderate to advanced ageing concerns.
          </p>

          <h4>Injectable Treatments (Botox)</h4>
          <p>
            Botox relaxes facial muscles responsible for expression lines such as
            forehead lines, frown lines, and crow’s feet. It helps soften wrinkles,
            prevent deepening of lines, and maintain natural facial expressions.
          </p>

          <p>
            A combination of treatments is often recommended for best and long-lasting
            results, which is planned during consultation with our dermatologists.

          <h3>Treatment Process & Aftercare</h3>

          <p>
            Every anti-ageing treatment at Derma Co begins with a detailed skin analysis
            conducted by an experienced dermatologist. This assessment includes
            evaluation of skin texture, elasticity, pigmentation, and ageing pattern
            to determine the most suitable treatment plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on the skin analysis, a personalized treatment approach is created.
            During the procedure, patients may experience mild sensations depending on
            the treatment type, which are generally safe and well tolerated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Post-treatment care is essential for achieving optimal and long-lasting
            results. Patients are advised to protect their skin from sun exposure,
            follow gentle skincare routines, stay hydrated, and attend scheduled
            follow-up visits as recommended by the dermatologist.
          </p>

          <p>
            Proper aftercare not only enhances results but also helps prevent
            complications and supports long-term skin health.
